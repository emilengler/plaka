# plaka

*plaka* is an attempt to implement the [*Tor directory format*](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/dir-spec.txt) using the [*pest*](https://pest.rs/) parser generator.
The motivation is to reduce the amount of code found within the `tor-netdoc` crate of the [Arti](https://arti.torproject.org) project.
Only time will tell how this will turn out.
